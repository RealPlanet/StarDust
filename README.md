# StarDust
(The name is not a reference to SW!)

StarDust is a custom programming language.
Source files are compiled into a special bytecode which is then ran by the SDVM (StarDust Virtual Machine).

It's purpouse is to be embedded into other C++ projects (ie Game Engines/ Games/ ecc...)

# Note

The compile and execution pipeline is currently not fully ready nor behaves as intended.
